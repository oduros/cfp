An open source database compiled from Dobromir D. Velkov PhD thesis. The database was constructed by a Python 3 script designed to extract consistently the listed tables from the source PDF. 

## Database
The database is accessible here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10700966
It follows the listing conventions introduced by Racah and Nielson & Koster. 

## Script
The provided Python 3 script is a short example of how one can use the database to build Racah unit tensor operators with cfp.
